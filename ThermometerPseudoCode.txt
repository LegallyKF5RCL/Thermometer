-Timer
	-1 of them
		-trigger every so often
			-for testing
				-500ms
			-for field use
				-30s
		-used to tell the chip when to figure out the temp and display it
		*used to wake up chip from sleep?
		*use to put the chip back to sleep?
			*should sleep stuff be done in an ISR

-A2D
	-1 of them
	-every time the timer procs
	-run an A2D on the thermo-transistor thing voltage output
	-used to figure out the temperature
		-This could be a table from the datasheet
			-which may need calibration
				-because who can really trust a product engineer
		-This could be a lookup table I generate
			-based on a function curve in the datasheet
		-This could be a ratio if the volts per degree of temperature is linear
			-math
				-floating point probably
					-accuracy is not that important for the system requirements
						-so truncate it (just use integer types anyway)
		-This could be a function
			-either given to me, or derived (I hope not...)
			-probably will need some adjustment
			-lookup table unecessary
				-we are not in a time critical scenario

-UART
	-send the temperature out to the serial LCD 
		-LCD is detachable, it would kinda be a misuse of a 20$ screen for this simple a system
	-This will require a translation 
		-from the temperature number I found from the A2D
		-to the character I need to send to the LCD

-GPIOs
	-3, 8-segment displays should provide sufficient readout
		-such as over 100 degrees, or less than 0 -> (-20 degrees)
	-Research needed to figure out how to work those things
	-I think I can use 2 pins and 3 shift registers
		-one pin for outputing the states
		-one pin for clocking the shift register
		-based on what sequence of numbers I need
			-I coorespond each number to a binary sequence
				*8 or 16 bits needed will be determined later
			-bitwise-and the lsb with 0x01
